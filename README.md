Railway platfrom crossing made with pic16f887,4 bit Lcd, IR Proximity sensor and indication light. 
It also contains a DC motor which helps in closing and opening of the platform for pedestrian users.
Here i have used LCD in 4 bit mode so i could save some pins for other uses.
Indication lights like red and green lights are used for the pedestrian users to indicate the train status.
Trains arrival and departure is monitored using IR proximity sensor (If needed use mental sensor which avoids the detection of animals or humans).
